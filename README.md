# ToP-Admin-Dashboard

Issues to be sorted: 

1. Sidebar - Profile tag (probably as a result of profile being used in another section)

Fixed - 14/3/23

2. Extra white space on the top bar so that it doesn't look so creased.

3. Search bar could be bigger

4. Top right 'Jamie Fraser' to be single line 

5. Trending box to be aligned correctly 

6. Project cards to be more consistent (even out white space.)
